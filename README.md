# TicTacToe Predictor

### Name: Adrian Olmos

## Overview 

Implemented to find any possible ways for 4 X's to exist without winning in the next move or current move, assuming there are no O's. It will output all ways, if it is red then it is an invalid solution, it will also output the row, column, or diagonal that it fails to pass.
